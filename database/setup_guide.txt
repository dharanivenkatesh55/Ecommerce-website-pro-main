### How to Import Your Database Schema in XAMPP (phpMyAdmin)

Since you have already created the `ecommerce` database, follow these steps to create the tables:

1. **Open the Schema File**:
   - Open the content of `database/schema.sql`.
   - Select All (Ctrl+A) and Copy (Ctrl+C).

2. **Open phpMyAdmin**:
   - Go to your browser and visit: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
   - On the left sidebar, click on the database you created: **ecommerce**.

3. **Open the SQL Tab**:
   - Look at the tabs at the top of the screen (Structure, SQL, Search, Query, etc.).
   - Click on the **SQL** tab.

4. **Paste and Execute**:
   - You will see a large white text box.
   - **Paste** (Ctrl+V) the code you copied from `schema.sql` into this box.
   - Click the **Go** button (usually at the bottom right or bottom left of the text box).

### What happens next?
- You will see a green success message.
- If you click on **Structure** or the `ecommerce` database again, you will surely see your new tables: `users`, `products`, `categories`, etc.
- You **do not** need to create table names manually. The code (`CREATE TABLE ...`) does that for you automatically.

### Next Step
Once you see the green success message, your database is ready! You can now start your backend server.
